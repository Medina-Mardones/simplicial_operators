    "In 1947, Steenrod introduced by means of formulae the cup-$i$ products on the cochains of spaces. These bilinear maps give rise to the natural cohomology operations \n",

    "As motivation for the practical use of Steenrod squares $Sq^k$ here are a few situations where they are a convenient distinguishing tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The real projective plane (sphere with antipodal points identified) and the wedge of a circle and a sphere (their union with a point from each identified together) have, with $\\mathbb F_2$-coefficients, the same betti numbers, yet the rank of $Sq^1$ tells them apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Similarly, the complex projective plane and the wedge of a 2-sphere and a 4-sphere have the same betti numbers with any coefficients, yet the rank of $Sq^2$ tells them apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The suspensions (join with two points) of the two spaces above have the same betti numbers and also isomorphic cohomology rings (cup product), yet $Sq^2$ tells them apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steenrod's formulae for the cup-$i$ products extend the Alexander-Whitney product on cochains. This non-commutative product induces the commutative algebra structure in cohomology, and we can interpret the higher cup-$i$ products \n",

# sOps2

This package allows the user to define and manipulate simplicial operators at the even prime. 

Some standard simplicial operators are preloaded, for example:
1. Alexander-Whitney and Eilenberg-Zilber
2. Steenrod cup-i products and squares
3. The action of the Surjection operad
4. The action of the Barratt-Eccles operad
5. A construction of Cartan coboundaries

A collection of notebooks is available to explain these simplicial operators.

**Instalation:** `pip install simplicial_operators`
